* Interview questions needs a default scope to handling ordering of the questions in an interview
* Need a way to get an average rating of a candidate's answer to questions - exclude the null rankings
* Could we remove the candidate_id column from an interview and use interview_participants to track both interviewers and candidates in some way?
* Can we build out a mechanism to provide an interviewer with their upcoming schedule of interviews?
